For function parsing separate all of the elements with a space.
So for example:
"cos(x)+y" is wrong
"cos ( x ) + y" is valid

It also reads the decimal point, not a comma.
So if you want to write down 1/10 in decimals, you'll have to write "0.1", not "0,1".
It might depend on the operating system that you're using, so take this note with a grain of salt
